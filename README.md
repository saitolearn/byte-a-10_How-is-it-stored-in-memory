byte a=10_How is it stored in memory


* How is this stored in the memory:

byte a = 10;

Great question! Let's explore how the line:

java
Copy
Edit
byte a = 10;
is stored in memory in a simple, clear way.

ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Breakdown:
âœ… 1. Variable Declaration
java
Copy
Edit
byte a;
You're telling the Java compiler:
âž¤ "Reserve 1 byte (8 bits) of memory to store an integer value."

The variable name is a.

The type byte is a primitive data type in Java.

âœ… 2. Value Assignment
java
Copy
Edit
a = 10;
You store the value 10 inside that reserved memory location.

10 in binary (8 bits) is:

Copy
Edit
00001010
ðŸ’¾ Memory Representation
Variable Name	Type	Size in Memory	Stored Value (Decimal)	Stored Value (Binary)
a	byte	1 byte (8 bits)	10	00001010

ðŸ“Œ Important Notes
A byte in Java can hold values from -128 to +127.

It uses two's complement representation internally.

Java stores primitive types like byte on the stack (if it's a local variable), not heap.

ðŸ§ª What happens in memory?
Java assigns a memory address for a (e.g., 0x1000 â€” just an example).

At that address, it stores the binary 00001010.
